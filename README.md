This program is a Python-based pathfinding tool that helps users find routes and calculate distances between various cities in the UK using different search algorithms.

Features:
  -
  - Search algorithms: depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), A* search, Dijkstra's algorithm
  - Predefined list of cities: Manchester, Holyhead, Liverpool, York, Carlisle, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Oban, Aberdeen, Inverness
  - Dictionary defining distnaces between cities

Prerequisites:
  -
  - Python 3 is required to run the code
  - The `heapq` library is used for the A* and Dijkstra algorithms and is included in the Python Standard Library

How To Use:
  -
  - Execute the code in a Python environment
  - Enter start and destination cities from the list of options
  - See output distances provided by each search algorithm
